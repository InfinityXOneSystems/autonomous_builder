# Blueprints

Blueprints are portable repo templates. Each blueprint is a folder that can be copied into a new repo.

- node-api-cloudrun: Express API skeleton + health endpoints
- node-lib-typescript: Library skeleton
- node-automations: Automation-oriented skeleton (this repo style)

You can add any industry-specific blueprint here without changing Infinity Prime.
